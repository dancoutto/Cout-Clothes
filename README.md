In order to test my knowledge and learn even more about modern and responsive Front-End,
after Alura's certification in "HTML and CSS: development environments, file structure and tags",
I decided to create the interface for an e-Commerce website. 
To do this, I created the fictitious Cout Clothes, "my clothing brand".
I also took courses from "Uanela Como". The website is made in HTML, CSS and JS. Later,
I intend to integrate the Back-End and make the website fully functional.
